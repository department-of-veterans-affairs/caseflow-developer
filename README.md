# Caseflow Developer

If this were to be a production-grade app, there's a lot of refactoring that could be done.

## Development
You must have the following env vars. Ask a current developer for them:

```bash
export GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=
export GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
export GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```
